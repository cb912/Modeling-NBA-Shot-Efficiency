# Modeling Shot Efficiency in the NBA

[Project](https://sta210-fa20.netlify.app/project/) for STA 210, Fall 2020

Our project conducts a thorough analysis of game data from the 2014-2015 season of the National Basketball Association (NBA) using a variety of statistical methods, and investiages a series of factors which ultimately determine whether or not a shot is made into a basket. 

codebook

Shot number --> The shot number for that player in that specific game (8 would mean it was the playerâ€™s 8th shot in that game)

Shot_clock --> How many seconds were left on the shot clock when the player shot the basketball

Shot_distance --> How far away the player was from the basketball when shooting

Dribbles --> The number of dribbles the player took before shooting

Touch_time --> How long the player touched the ball for before shooting (after being passed to)

PTS_TYPE --> whether the shot was 2 or 3-pointer

Closest_Defender --> Who the closest defender was to the shooting player

Close_Def_Distance --> How far away said player was when the ball was shot

Player_name --> Who shot the ball

FGM --> Whether the shot went in or not (response variable)
